## NPM Package Issues

### moment

I have pinned the moment library to version 2.18.1 because of an error
with message ```Moment(...).tz is not a function```. The following issues
detail the error:

- https://github.com/moment/moment-timezone/issues/449
- https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/4216

### standard

I have installed a beta version of standard v11 to deal with an eslint error.
